Candidate [0:00:24 - 0:00:56]: [HAPPY] So I started working in the city as a trader in 2008, which is obviously when the big crisis happened, the financial crash my job was to bet on interest rates, summarizing interest rates go up when the economys strong, down when the economy is weak, they collapsed to zero in 2008 and my job was to bet on when will they come back up which is when will the economy recover and the market bet every single year that would have a recovery that didn't happen I figured that this is because of inequality basically rich people save poor people spend inequality was rising so there's a lot of saving, not a lot of spending, I bet on that and I became citybank most profit. [EMO_UNKNOWN] Trader, and that's how I make money.
